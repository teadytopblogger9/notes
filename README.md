- "Today's programming wisdom is to focus on writing clean, maintainable code. This means using clear and descriptive variable names, writing modular and reusable functions, and commenting your code thoroughly. It's also important to follow best practices and design patterns for your chosen programming language and framework. Remember, code is read more often than it's written, so make it easy for others (and your future self) to understand."

- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors.

First, prioritize your tasks. When you're working on a project, it' s important to determine which tasks are most critical to the success of the project. By focusing on these tasks first, you can ensure that your code is of high quality and meets the requirements of your project timeline. You can use techniques such as the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have and Could have) to categorize your task and prioritize them accordingly. 
 - MoScW方法：Must Have（必须完成的任务），Should Have （应该完成，对项目的成功至关重要）和Could Have (可以完成但不影响项目成功)
Next, planning ahead is crucial. Before starting a new project or a task, take some time to plan out your approach. Create a roadmap that outlines the key steps involved in completing the task or project and the resources needed to succeed. Planning ahead will not only help to keep you organized but also prevent you from getting lost in the code or wasting time on unnecessary tasks that don't contribute to your end goal. Finally, stay organize. As you work on your projects, maintain a clean and organized codebase. Use version control systems like Git to track your changes and collaborate with others. Organized code makes it easier to maintain, update,and add new features in future. It also helps to reduce the chances of introducing bugs or errors in code.
